# SER225 Platformer Game

## What is this?
This is a game created for Quinnipiac's SER225 Agile Development class.
Students will be paired up in teams for an entire semester, and will utilize agile development to work further on this game.
This usually involves adding features and fixing bugs (I'm sure there are bugs...)

## How to run this project?
I did not use any external libraries for this, so you can clone this repo as is and run it out of the box with Java (min version 8).
I recommend using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse to run this game.

The main method for the game is in the `Game` package > `Game.java` file.<br>
The main method for the map editor is in the `MapEditor` package > `MapEditor.java` file.

## Documentation
This project includes a GitHub pages website in the `docs` folder where the documentation resides.<br>
It can be accessed at [https://a-r-t.github.io/SER-225-Game-Platformer/](https://a-r-t.github.io/SER-225-Game-Platformer/).

Changes to content in the `docs` folder will not show up on the website unless they are pushed to the `master` branch.
