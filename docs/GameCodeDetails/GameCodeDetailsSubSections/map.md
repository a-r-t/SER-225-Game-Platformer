# Map

## What does the Map class do?

The `Map` class (found in the `Level` package) is responsible for updating and drawing nearly everything during the game, which includes the map tiles, the camera (current view -- which part of the map is being shown on the screen), NPCs, etc. 
It has a lot of duties to carry out, but a vast majority of the `Map` class is just "setup" -- once everything is ready to go, it just continuously calls `update` on every class instance it holds and lets them decide what they want to do.

Everything you see in the below gif except is handled/coordinated by the `Map` class or its `Camera` class instance.
The only exception is the player, which has its own class `Player`.
