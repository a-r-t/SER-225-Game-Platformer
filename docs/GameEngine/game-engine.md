# Game Engine

## What is the difference between a game and a game engine?

The difference between a particular game and a game engine (also called a game framework) is that "game logic" is specific to one game while a game engine is created
to be reused. The game engine is designed to create an environment from which a game can be made. Game engines typically have built in
functionality for loading resources (such as images), detecting user input (such as checking if a key on the keyboard is pressed),
and running the game through a cycled game loop that continually updates game logic and renders graphics to the screen.

Most game developers do not write their own game engine, and instead use an existing one that has the features they require to
create their desired game, such as [Unity](https://unity.com/) or [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/). Many larger game companies
have written their own game engines, which is then used to create many different games, such as the famous [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_(game_engine)) game engine created by [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com/en/).

For this game, the engine was created from scratch using components from the Java Swing library (really just the JPanel) and everything else was
done using vanilla Java. While the engine itself is not "specific" to the platformer game genre, several other components were included
that fit nicely with platformer game logic.

## Overview of this game engine

The code architecture and design for this engine was inspired by [XNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_XNA), Microsoftâ€™s old game programming framework that they supported for anyone to use to write games for the Xbox 360. 
While XNA is no longer supported by Microsoft and stopped receiving updates, the framework has been ported and released open source under the title [Monogame](https://www.monogame.net/).

Below are some features of the game engine, which are defined and created in the `Engine` package.
